1. Update `appSettings.json` to include your Azure Open AI endpoint.
2. Either use the provided image or drop a "character" image into the folder, set to "Always copy" and reference it in `appSettings.json`
3. The easiest way to get started is to deploy `gpt-4o-mini` and `gpt-image-1` and give the deployment name the same name as the model.
4. The harder way is to deploy your own chat and image models, then specify the deployment names in configuration.
5. Build and run.
